# TRAPI Message Constraints

Beyond the constraints described by the TRAPI OpenAPI schema, we wish to selectively enforce some additional constraints on specific operations.

* "no orphaned edges" - The `subject` and `object` for all qedges and kedges MUST map to qnode and knode keys, respectively.

  ```python
  for qedge in message["query_graph"]["edges"]:
      assert qedge["subject"] in message["query_graph"]["nodes"]
      assert qedge["object"] in message["query_graph"]["nodes"]
  for kedge in message["knowledge_graph"]["edges"]:
      assert kedge["subject"] in message["knowledge_graph"]["nodes"]
      assert kedge["object"] in message["knowledge_graph"]["nodes"]
  ```

* "no orphaned bindings" - Each binding MUST map a knode or kedge key to a qnode or qedge key, respectively.

  ```python
  for result in message["results"]:
      for qnode_id, bindings in result["node_bindings"]:
          assert qnode_id in message["query_graph"]["nodes"]
          for binding in bindings:
              assert binding["id"] in message["knowledge_graph"]["nodes"]
      for qedge_id, bindings in result["edge_bindings"]:
          assert qedge_id in message["query_graph"]["edges"]
          for binding in bindings:
              assert binding["id"] in message["knowledge_graph"]["edges"]
  ```

* "unique query graph ids" - All qnode and qedge keys MUST be unique within the qgraph.

  ```python
  qelement_ids = list(message["query_graph"]["nodes"]) + list(message["query_graph"]["edges"])
  assert len(qelement_ids) == len(set(qelement_ids))
  ```

* "unique knowledge graph ids" - All knode and kedge keys MUST be unique globally. i.e. the same id should not be used to refer to two distinct kedges, even in response to two completely distinct queries.

  ```python
  kelement_ids = list(message["knowledge_graph"]["nodes"]) + list(message["knowledge_graph"]["edges"])
  assert len(kelement_ids) == len(set(kelement_ids))
  ```

* "results complete" - All results include bindings for every qgraph element.

  ```python
  for result in message["results"]:
      for qnode_id in message["query_graph"]["nodes"]:
          assert qnode_id in result["node_bindings"]
      for qedge_id in message["query_graph"]["edges"]:
          assert qedge_id in result["edge_bindings"]
  ```

* "no orphaned knowledge graph elements" - All knowledge graph nodes and edges will be referenced by at least one result binding.

  ```python
  bound_knodes = [
      binding["id"]
      for result in message["results"]
      for bindings in result["node_bindings"].values()
      for binding in bindings
  ]
  bound_kedges = [
      binding["id"]
      for result in message["results"]
      for bindings in result["edge_bindings"].values()
      for binding in bindings
  ]
  for knode_id in message["knowledge_graph"]["nodes"]:
      assert knode_id in bound_knodes
  for kedge_id in message["knowledge_graph"]["edges"]:
      assert kedge_id in bound_kedges
  ```

* "max X results" - There are no more than X results.

  ```python
  assert len(message["results"]) <= X
  ```
