id: overlay_fisher_exact_test
subclass_of: overlay
name: Overlay Fisher exact test
description: Fisher exact test computes the Fisher's Exact Test p-values of the connection between a list of given nodes with specified query id (subject_qnode_key e.g. n01) to their adjacent nodes with specified query id (object_qnode_key e.g. n02) in the message knowledge graph. This information is then added as an edge attribute to a virtual edge which is then added to the query graph and knowledge graph. It can also allow you to filter out the user-defined insignificance of connections based on a specified p-value cutoff or return the top n smallest p-value of connections and only add their corresponding virtual edges to the knowledge graph.
