# Purpose of this repo
Initially, design considerations will be discussed and voted on. Eventually, these will be incorporated to a YAML-like document describing the workflow language, how it works, etc.

# Workflow Runner
The following repo will, after you stand it up, provide an endpoint to which you can post workflows and registered ARAs will execute the operations they have implemented.
